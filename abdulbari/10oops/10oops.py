"""
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and methods to operate on that data. Four main principles of OOP are:
1. Abstraction üèõÔ∏è
Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and only exposing essential features of an object.

Example:
When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes, but you don‚Äôt need to know how the engine works internally.
In programming, you can achieve abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.

2. Inheritance üè°
Definition: Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent-child relationship).

Example:
A Dog is an Animal. So, instead of defining "breathing" for every animal, the Dog class can inherit it from the Animal class.

3. Encapsulation üîí
Definition: Encapsulation is data hiding by restricting direct access to some of an object‚Äôs components and only allowing controlled access through methods.

Example:
Your bank account balance is private, but you can access it via methods like deposit() or withdraw().

4. Polymorphism üé≠
Definition: Polymorphism allows the same method name to have different behaviors based on the object calling it.

Types of Polymorphism:
Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism) ‚Äì When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method defined in the parent class.
Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism) ‚Äì When multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
